## [Rationale for Framework Choice](https://www.tatvasoft.com/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue/)

### Why We Chose React

1. Learning Curve

    React is simple and focus on building UI components. The core library is minimalistic, focusing on the view layer, which allows people to learn the basics quickly.

2. Flexibility and Customization

    React is flexible. This flexibility allows us to integrate libraries and tools (Like tailwind) without being constrained by a rigid structure. This enables us to customize the application more.

3. Industry Adoption

    React is widely used in the industry, which means there is lots of tutorials and support to be obtained online. It's also great to have in our CV and portfolio for after our studies. 

4. Usage

    Our vision was that of a Single Page Application (SPA), where you can navigate and the website only needs to swap out the components, instead of navigate to a whole new URL. React is exceptional for SPA because of the virtual DOM with component-based structure and client-side rendering.

### Comparison with Other Frameworks

**Vue.js**
 
Pros: 

- Simplicity and ease of learning

- Flexible

- Strong community and good performance

Cons:

- Smaller ecosystem compared to React

- Less mature and less common

- Not a fan of the syntax

**Angular**

Pros:

- Comprehensive framework with built-in features

- Robust tools for large-scale applications

Cons:

- Steeper learning curve

- Less flexible

- We didn't want to use TypeScript for this project

After evaluating we concluded that React was the best choice for our project, mostly because of the learning curve and common use in the industry. As a result however, it's easily scaleable and maintainable.
